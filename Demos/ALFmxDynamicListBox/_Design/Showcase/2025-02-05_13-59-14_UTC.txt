Maybe a little out of the nor of what we're usually seeing in this contest - but I love the artistic vision of this image. Lava cradeling a human - like our early cradling humanity - it's really beautiful.⁠

Natural, organic and leaves you with a sense of quite winer bliss. The contract from blue to black to white helps make this a successful graphic image.⁠

Oh! Somewhere I want to go! This is a lovely drone image with cool shapes and a great sense of place. The toning is soft and shaply and accentuates the icy blue! A really pretty image!⁠

I think this belongs image belongs on a huge wall! The pallet is beautiful and straight striking lines of the slightly distorted trains are a patchwork pallet of beautiful.⁠
